# Ripple - Case Study
---
## Overview and Origin
[Ripple](https://ripple.com/) was initially incorporated under the name "OpenCoin" in September of 2012. The original founders of the company were Jed McCaleb & Chris Larsen. The company was founded under the vision to realize the Internet Of Value. To allow money to flow freely & without friction similar to as we saw information flow freely with the deployment of the Internet of Things. Ripple has raised a total of 293.8M USD in funding over 13 rounds of investment. This included Secondary Market investments, Series A/B investments, Angel investments as well as Seed investments. The company has publicly discussed it has plans of going public with an IPO but it currently is awaiting for more regulatory clarity in the United States. 
## Business Activities
### Unlocking the Power of Blockchain
Ripple believes the current global payments infrastructure does not meet today's business or consumer demand. By utilizing the power of blockchain and digital asset technology, financial institutions can dramatically improve the speed, cost and reliability of how people transact around the world. 
### Creating an Inclusive Financial System
Ripple's solutions unify the infrastucture underlying global payments. But it doesn't stop there. Through the power of decentralized financial technology, institutions and the businesses and people they serve have access to an open and inclusive system no matter where they are in the world.
### Accelerating the Internet of Value
This new era in global finance takes shape in the Internet of Value (IoV)- a world where money moves like information does today. Like the internet's impact on information sharing and communcation, the IoV will serve as an explosive catalyst for value exchange: spawnning a new chapter in globalization, redefining entire industries and giving rise to new ones.
#### Intended Customers/ Market size
Ripple's primary customers include central banks, governments, payment providers and financial institutions. Ripple aims to reshape the underlying mechanism of how money is transferred & settled and with that it's real customer market cap can include up to all of the money.
#### Why Ripple?
What sets Ripple apart from it's competition is it's On-Demand Liquidity service, RippleNet leverages the digital asset XRP as a bridge between two currencies, allowing you to eliminate pre-funding of destination accounts, reduce operational costs and unlock capital. Ripple is able to offer its sevices via the XRP Ledger and its native token- XRP. XRP is a digital asset built for payments. It is the native digital asset on the XRP Ledger- an open-source, permissionless and decentralized blochain technology that can setlle transactions in 3-5 seconds. XRP can be sent directly without needing a central intermediary, making it a convenient instrument in bridging two different currencies quickly and efficiently. XRP is faster, less costly and more scalable than any other digital asset currently available. Ripple is partnering directly with financial institutions and is enabling them to settle transactions via it's On Demand Liquidity product that utilizes XRP.

## Landscape
### Domain
Ripple stands in the FinTech domain and is considered to be a payment solutions provider. 
### Major Trends & Innovations
The biggest trend over recent years within the FinTech domain has been adoption. While most of the underlying technology enabling better payment solutions has been around for 7-8 years, adoption has been slow & we began to see financial institutions utilizing Ripple's as well as its competitor's solutions over the last ~3 years. In present day, the most exciting aspect of companies such as Ripple is that we are beginning to learn that governments across the world are partnering with private FinTech companies in the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC's) which are expected to begin rolling out in the [following years](https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cbdc-wp-2020.pdf).
### Competition
Other competitors in the space include: [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/?locale=en), [R3 Corda](https://www.r3.com/corda-enterprise/?_bt=505234158440&_bk=r3%20blockchain%20technology&_bm=b&_bn=g&_bg=124715224488&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-LOEBhDCARIsABrC0Tmd0QVLZyWT9-KNsSTTApFkp7ZcQuYVFhhfIReilTAqUHpt3AVWIC0aAm-gEALw_wcB), [SWIFT](https://www.swift.com/) and many more.
## Ripple's 2020 Momentum
### On-Demand Liquidity
Last year was RippleNet's best year to date. In 2020, the company processed about 3 million transactions over RippleNet which is nearly 5x volume growth compared to 2019. Notably, ODL experienced 12x year-over-year growth, and transactions had a notional value of ~2.4B USD.
### RippleX
Developers have built on XRPL for its performance, low cost, reliability and security, accessibility and inherently green attributes. Last year, the XRP Ledger became the first major blockchain globally to decarbonize in partnership with the Energy Web Foundation. Ripple also worked with the XRP Ledger Foundation, a global non-profit fostering development and innovation of the XRPL, to solidify XRPL as a leader in sustainability, and ship new updates aimed at making it the de facto blockchain for crypto-native developers. 

Today, XRPL and Interledger Protocol combined reach an estimated 12 million users, with over 100 known developer projects aimed at solving real use cases with blockchain technology and crypto. RippleX has partnered with more than 40 companies championing XRP utility including Coil, Forte, BRD, Bitpay, XRPL Labs and Flare, and will continue to provide SDKs, services and tools aimed at fostering crypto innovation on the XRP Ledger. 

## Recommendations
As I conducted my research on Ripple, I came to the realization that the sky is truly the limit for Ripple's growth. Their products have been working flawlessly, and their approach to offering its clients services has been outstanding. While the company has shown incredible adoption in parts of the world such as Thailand, Japan, and the UAE, they have encountered some major regulatory roadblocks when it comes to expanding their services within the United States. So as far as my recommendation goes, it goes without saying that Ripple should continue to diligently strive towards a resolution with its current lawsuit against the Securities Echange Commision. Once this roadblock is passed, I believe Ripple should switch its focus on expansion within the United States which should lead to a much larger adoption world-wide.
